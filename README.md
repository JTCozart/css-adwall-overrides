## About This repo 
I created this repo because I am tired of sites trying to block adblocks by disabling features of the site through CSS trickery. Now I don't usually mind non-intrusive adds, but when you disable adblocks on a lot of these sites the ads are very intrusive and block most of the main content. I really wish content creators would monitize their site through the use of non-intrusive adverts. Until that happnes, I'll try to maintain this repo. This allows users to get past that. With that being said, sites are being updated all the time with anti-adblock techniques which makes mataining this repo difficult (that and I will only make an adblock for sites that I am using). So feel free to submit a pull request with your favorite sites, and I'll gladly review and accept. Any help mataining this is greatly appreciated.
