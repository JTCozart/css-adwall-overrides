# css-adwall-overrides
CSS overrides for specific sites to get pass adwalls using stylus for chrome https://add0n.com/stylus.html

## How To use

- Install the stylus add-op for chrome, brave or firefox. 
- Navigate to the site that has the ad-block ad-wall that you wish to disable (this usually shows up in the form of a non-scrollable page) 
- Add the CSS overrides from the desired site folders in this repo and refresh the page. 

## About This repo 
I created this repo because I am tired of sites trying to block adblocks by disabling features of the site through CSS trickery. This allows users to get past that. With that being said, sites are being updated all the time with anti-adblock techniques which makes mataining this repo difficult (that and I will only make an adblock for sites that I am using). So feel free to submit a pull request with your favorite sites, and I'll gladly review and accept. Any help mataining this is greatly appreciated.
